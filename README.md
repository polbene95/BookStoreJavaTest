First things first, what I need you to do is to create a basic interface with books.

Each book has to have a:
- Title
- Author
- Description
- Cover 
- Language 

Apart from that, I need you to create a second tab with authors. Each author has a:

- Name
- Bio
- List of Books

Also, the user should be able to update your database of books and authors form the interface.
So I suggest you to create a third tab where you can create new authors and books.

(Hint: Whenever you create a new book you should send an image for the cover. 
This website provides a hosting for the image: https://imgbb.com/. 
If the book has no cover you should generate a predefined cover image)
